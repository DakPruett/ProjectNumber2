**chat room style**

create login page that stores usernames and passwords.
after logging in get taken to a chat room esque area where you can communicate with some one else and it posts almost like a discussion board.
if you log out have it store your username and password so that you can log back in later.
it doesnt need to store the conversation, its more snapchat than text.
has user authentification and has cookies built in to the login page?
have the passwords hidden for accounts.
